/**
 * Similar to how combineReducers allows you to create a container reducer to
 * delegate actions where each key maps to a reducer to handle the key's value--
 * createObjectReducer allows you to create a container reducer to delegate
 * actions where *all* keys use the *same* reducer, but the keys are not known
 * ahead of time.
 * @param {Object} config The configuration object used to create the reducer.
 * @param {Function} config.getKey Accepts an `action` param and returns a key.
 * @param {Function} config.valueReducer A standard redux reducer function.
 * @returns {Function} A standard redux reducer function.
